## Process to get tested

If you get a positive self-assessment:

* Go to the closest hospital and see a doctor. They will conduct a preliminary check and pre-determine if you need to get tested for Covid-19. Some of the conditions used to determine if you are high risk are 
  * Do you have a fever? Other Covid-19 symptoms? 
  * Have you recently travelled abroad? 
  * Have you been in contact with anyone that has recently travelled abroad? 
  * Are you in the medical profession? 
  * Have you been in contact with anyone in the medical profession? 
* If the hospital determines there is a reasonable chance you have Covid-19, then 
  * They will take a test sample to be sent for testing. It will take between 24 to 48 hours to get the results 
  * They will put you in isolation at the hospital till the results come back
